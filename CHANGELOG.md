### Changes
#### Enchanting
- Changed Enchanting tables to accept carpets, potted plants, candles, chains, cauldrons, brewing stands, and chiseled bookshelves within the enchanting area
- Changed Anvil Enchanting
  - The "Too Expensive!" message has been replaced with "Unrepairable!"
    - The idea of the "Too Expensive!" repair limit is to mimic how, in real life, you can't keep repairing an object over and over, forever. While we are not removing this feature, we have decided to rename it to help make this more clear.
  - The limit for adding enchantments is now tied to enchantability
    - The message for an item with too many enchantments is "Magic Capacity Met!"
  - Repairing an item enchanted with mending will have an enchantment level cost of 1.
  - Enchanting and repairing an item enchanted with mending will have a decreased enchantment cost
    - This cost is reduced by 4 levels, to a minimum of 1 level.
  - Repairing and Enchanting in an anvil have been split into two numbers.
    - Repair Cost (also known as the Prior Work Penalty): Functions the same as it did before, but now, enchanting does not increase the Repair Cost
    - Magic Level: Is a separate number that increases each time an item is enchanted. An item can be enchanted until you reach the magic limit, as mentioned above.

#### Enchantments
- Changed Piercing to reduce the effectiveness of armor by 10% with each level
- Changed Impaling to affect all mobs that are in contact with water for parity with Bedrock Edition

#### Potions
- Changed liquid consumables to be consumed faster!
  - The time has been reduced to 20 ticks, to match the Combat Tests
- Changed consumable potions to be stackable up to 16 items
  - This is to match the combat tests
- Changed potions naming to be based on their enhancement
  - Example: A Potion of Swiftness that lasts for 8 minutes is now called a "Long Potion of Swiftness"
  - Example: A Potion of Swiftness that provides Speed II is now called a "Strong Potion of Swiftness"
  - This is based on their internal code names

#### The Wither
- Changed launched Wither Skulls to be on fire
  - This was originally intended by Mojang, but caused crashes
  - The skull flames are blue, to match Soul Fire
  - These skulls now place Soul Fire when they explode
- Changed Wither health to scale with difficulty to match Bedrock Edition
  - Easy 300 HP -> 300 HP
  - Normal 300 HP -> 450 HP
  - Hard 300 HP -> 600 HP
- The Wither now dive bombs and summons Wither Skeletons when it has reached 50% health
  - This is also to match Bedrock Edition
- All entities with the `wither_friends` entity type tag will no longer target the Wither

  Note:  The Bedrock Edition's Wither "Dash" behavior was purposefully ignored.

#### Beacons
- Changed Beacon effect range to be 4 times as high
  - Level 1 Beacon Range:
    - 20 meters -> 80 meters
  - Level 2 Beacon Range:
    - 30 meters -> 120 meters
  - Level 3 Beacon Range:
    - 40 meters -> 160 meters
  - Level 4 Beacon Range:
    - 50 meters -> 200 meters
- This helps balance a more difficult Wither boss battle

#### Structures
- Changed Swamp Hut cauldrons to now have a random potion effect inside of them, to match Bedrock Edition

#### Agricultural XP
- Changed fully grown crops to drop 0-2 XP when reaped

#### Blocks
- Changed overworld mushrooms to always be placeable on logs

- Added potion bottle archetypes
  - Some potions have different bottle shapes to better help visibility for those with colorblindness
  - These archetypes are:
    - Conical
    - Spherical
    - Vial
  - These archetypes are controlled via Data Tags
  - This design is to match Minecraft Dungeons
- Reverted the Uncraftable Potion texture to its pre-1.21 color (Magenta)

### Technical Changes
#### Camera Shake Events
Camera Shake events are now data-driven, similar to sound events. Camera shake event files are to be put in a `data/[datapack namespace]/subtlyd/camera_shake_event/` folder.
- Added `sound_event` field: a Sound Event ID, specifies what sound event should trigger the Camera Shake Event
- Added `range` field: a float, specifies the maximum distance that the camera shake can be experienced from
- Added `duration` field: an integer, specifies the amount of ticks that the camera shake will last
- Added `intensity` field: an optional float, specifies the intensity modifier value
  - Default: `4`

#### Data Tags
- Added `liquid_consumables` item tag
  - This is a list of consumables that can be considered liquids (e.g. stews, potions, etc.)
- Added `is_occult` damage type tag
  - This tag controls what types of damage Occult Protection can protect against
    - This includes magic, indirect magic, sonic booms, withering, and thorns
- Added `non_humanoid_armor` item tag
  - This tag is a list of armor items not for humanoids (e.g. diamond horse armor, wolf armor, etc.)
  - Any item with this tag will become enchantable with armor enchantments.
- Added `increases_magic_limit` enchantment tag
  - These enchantments increase the magic level limit of the item and decrease how quickly an item's magic level will increase
- Added `repairs_equipment` enchantment tag
  - These enchantments are incompatible with the abrading curse
- Added `conical` potion tag
  - By default, this includes potions of Strength, Weakness, Slow Falling, Wind Charging, and Decay
- Added `spherical` potion tag
  - By default, this includes potions of Water Breathing, Oozing, Infestation, and Turtle Master
- Added `vial` potion tag
  - By default, this includes potions of Swiftness, Slowness, Leaping, and Weaving

#### Enchantiblity
- The enchantability difference of two items in an anvil will scale the enchantment cost cap.
  - Enchantability difference is calculated as `|enchantability of item 1 - enchantability of item 2|`
  - The enchantment level cap is calculated by this formula: `(enchantability difference * 2) + 40`
    - Example: A diamond helmet (Enchantability level 10) in an anvil with an enchanted book (Enchantability level 0) will have a maximum enchantment cost of 55
      - If the cost gets any higher than this, the anvil will say "Unrepairable!"
    - The enchantment cap is always rounded up
    - The maximum enchantment level cap is now 100 (which can be achieved by combining two pieces of golden armor)
- Elytras now have an enchantability level of 9

- #### Entity Data

## [2.0] - 12/29/2025
#### Developer Notes:
Oh boy. Mojang changed the Minecraft version system... which made me reconsider our current versioning system (SemVar). Semantic Versioning is specifically for APIs (A.K.A. not a mod), so I think it would make sense to change up the versioning system for the mod as well. `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` isn't bad, though part of what this mod aims to do, is to re-capture the spirit of old Mojang (which includes having more "random" updates, that don't necessarily add groundbreaking changes (i.e. I would never want to bump the `MAJOR` number).

Because of this, I think it's most fitting that going forward we will adopt a `UPDATE.HOTFIX-BUILD` system. The Minecraft version suffix will also be dropped, for a few reasons:

1) Fabric will warn you if you install on the wrong version
2) The websites that this mod is currently available on (Modrinth and Curseforge) have filtering systems for the correct Minecraft version
3) The mod intends to have a "forward-looking" development cycle, so you can expect updates to focus on whatever the newest update is.

An example using this current update is: `2.0`. If a snapshot or beta is openly released, you can expect a suffix (e.g. `2.0-snapshot` or `2.0-beta`) 

### New Features
#### UI
- Added a render of the player on the Title Screen

#### Visuals
- Added a breaking animation for tents

### Changes
#### Visuals
- The method for rendering zombie leaders has changed to increase vanilla and mod compatibility
- Changed the camera angle for sleeping in a tent to look straight up

#### Mechanics
- The custom zombie leader health boost mechanics have been removed in favor of the vanilla implementation
- Changed the hitbox of tent entities to be more precise

#### Data
- Changed Screen Shake translation keys
  - `options.screen_shake` is now `options.accessibility.screen_shake`
  - `options.screen_shake`.tooltip is now `options.accessibility.screen_shake.tooltip`
- Added tent entity translations

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where Stone Pillar blocks could not be broken by a pickaxe
- Fixed a bug where tent entities lacked display names

## [1.1.0-alpha.4] - 12/3/2025
### Developer Notes & Technical Stuff
I plan to phase out using SemVer for various reasons. Semantic Versioning is for public APIs (which this is not), and I would like for my mod to follow a system like Mojang's, so that its versioning is familiar.
This will take effect in 2026. A new system will be announced on my Twitter or Reddit page, so keep an eye out.

I also want to say that a lot of code has been getting cleaned up to be more efficient and compatible with other mods, so a lot of the content has slowed down.

#### Events
- Raid difficulty logic has changed
  - "Raid difficulty" is a new value that is calculated as follows: `Raid Omen Level + Difficulty Level ID (0-3) + Raid Wave = Raid Difficulty`
    - For example, if you trigger a Level III Raid on Easy Mode, your Raid Difficulty on the second wave is `3 + 0 + 2 = 5`
  - Raid difficulty must reach level 10 before pillagers are able to spawn with Flame enchanted crossbows
    - i.e. Normal Difficulty with a raid omen of at least V, on wave 3 or higher OR Hard Difficulty with a raid omen of at least 4, on wave 3 or higher
  - Raid difficulty must reach level 7 for raid captains to spawn with Resistance II
    - Captains may still spawn in with Resistance I if the raid difficulty is at least level 4

#### Data

  - Camera Shake has been renamed "Screen Shake" to match Minecraft Dungeons
- `options.doCameraShake.tooltip` has been renamed to `options.camera_shake.tooltip`

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 10/15/25
### Added
#### Food
- Added Pottage
  - Crafted from a wheat sheaf, carrot, brown mushroom, and bowl
  - Restores 6 hunger points and 7.2 saturation points

#### Mechanics
- Unlit Campfire
- Named "Campfire". The original "Campfire" has been renamed to "Lit Campfire"
    - Can be crafted from sticks and logs
    - Can be lit traditionally or with sticks (with a 70% chance to fail)
- Fishing is now biome dependent! There's now strategy involved
  - If the fish can't be found swimming around in the water, you probably can't fish for it!
    - e.g. You won't find salmon in mangrove swamps, only tropical fish, so that's what you'll get from fishing
    - Salmon can be found anywhere above ground, but chances are increased in rivers and some ocean biomes
    - Cod love cold and/or deep waters
    - Tropical fish and pufferfish love warm waters
    - Squid can be found in rivers and oceans
  - You can not fish in The End dimension anymore

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 10/11/2025
### Added
#### Mechanics
- Zombie hoard leaders now have increased health
  - This fixes a long-running bug
  - The zombie leader's health scales based on local difficulty (i.e. they get stronger the more you play), ranging from 10 Hearts (20HP) to 50 Hearts (100HP)
      
- Raids have been tweaked
  - Pillagers may now shoot flaming arrows
    - This is only on Normal difficulty with Level V raids or Hard difficulty with Level IV or V raids
    - The likelihood of pillagers being able to shoot flaming arrows scales with the game difficulty
      - Though for all difficulties there's a 50% chance the enchantment pillagers spawn with, is flame
  - Raiders now get a boost of resistance once they become a captain
    - This scales with difficulty and raid level
    
- Flaming arrows can now ignite flammable materials
  - This is to make raids more dangerous and dynamic :)
  - Flaming arrows shot onto the east and west side of flat surfaces don't cause fire
    - "Lore" reason: Wind only blows north to south
    - Meta reason: There's a bug in Mojang's code preventing proper block detection
    - This can help balance out flaming arrows a little
  - Works with mobGriefing

- Tent
  - Can be slept in at nighttime
  - Does not reset your spawn point
  - Has 16 color variants

  - Can be fed to cats and wolves
  - There's a chance to find it in fisher cottages
  - Heroes of the Village have a chance to be thrown one by fisherman villagers
